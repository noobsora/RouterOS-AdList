## 📢 Project Overview

This project is based on several well-known and trusted ad-blocking rule sources. It aggregates and deduplicates these sources to generate a `hosts`-formatted domain blocklist that is compatible with the MikroTik RouterOS DNS Adlist module.The ad domain blocklist is automatically updated every 4 hours, making it ideal for RouterOS users who require system-wide ad blocking without the need for additional plugins.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

The domain sources are selected with a focus on mainland China, and usage outside of this region is not recommended.

---

## ✨ Project Features

* 🔄 **Automatic Updates**: The blocklist is refreshed every 4 hours via GitHub Actions.
* 🧹 **Smart Filtering & Deduplication**: Automatically removes duplicates, invalid entries, regular expressions, wildcards, IP addresses, and non-domain formats.
* ⚙️ **High Compatibility**: Output is fully compatible with the RouterOS DNS Adlist module.
* 🌍 **Trusted Sources**: Aggregates from reputable public rule providers including AdGuard, Cats-Team, Loyalsoldier, and more.
* 🇨🇳 **China-Optimized**: All source lists are carefully selected for effectiveness within mainland China.
